In 2014-09-10 a file named "google_5000000.7z" was leaked with 5000000 gmail
emails and passwords. I wrote this script to check if my email accounts were
in that leaked file.

Dependencies:
    - python 2.7
    - leak_file
    - contacts_file

Usage:
    - Download wordlsit_compare.py
    - Edit configuration options in this script.
    - In console, run: python compare.py

Output:
    - match_file
