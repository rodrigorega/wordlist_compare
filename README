In 2014-09-10 a file named "google_5000000.7z" was leaked with 5000000 gmail
emails and passwords. I wrote this script to check if my email accounts were
in that leaked file.

No comments in the code by the time, sorry.

Dependencies:
    - leak_file: csv file in format: my@email[leak_file_split]password
    - contacts_file: txt with emails

Usage:
    - Download wordlsit_compare.py
    - Edit configuration options in this script.
    - python compare.py

Output:
    - match_file: csv file with emails matched in "leak_file" and "contacts_file".

Changelog:
    - 2014-09-10: First release.
