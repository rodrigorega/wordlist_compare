# wordlist_compare

## Why?

In 2014-09-10 a file named "google_5000000.7z" was leaked with 5000000 gmail emails and passwords.  
I wrote this script to check if my email accounts were in that leaked file.

## Usage

```
Usage:
    - python wordlist_compare.py -l LEAK_LIST -m MY_LIST [-o OUTPUT_LIST] [-s CSV_SEPARATOR]
    - python wordlist_compare.py --help

```
